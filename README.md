Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can
build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax
tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:

- **General** enough to parse any programming language
- **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
- **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
- **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can
  be embedded in any application

Message: AADSTS50020: User account 'dinhhauduong0@gmail.com' from identity provider 'live.com' does not exist in tenant 'Microsoft' and cannot access the application '00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000'(Office 365 SharePoint Online) in that tenant. The account needs to be added as an external user in the tenant first. Sign out and sign in again with a different Azure Active Directory user account.
